This is a microservice for the CS 361 project. 
The purpose of this code is to create a server that recieves names of wikipedia articles and returns the first paragraph. Its primary use case is to provide descriptions of video games but can be used for any wikipedia content.

To use:
1. Launch main.py
2. Ensure the IP address displayed by main.py matches the IP on line 7 of sample_client.py
3. Run client.py
4. Enter names of wikipedia articles to recieve a one paragraph description

The code within sample client should be fairly straight forward to intergrate into larger projects to interact with the server.
